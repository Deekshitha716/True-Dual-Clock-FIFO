# True-Dual-Clock-FIFO
True Dual Clock FIFO using Binary and Gray Counters is a reliable data buffering system that enables safe data transfer between two independent clock domains. They are used for internal read and write operations, while Gray code counters ensure accurate pointer synchronization across clock domains, preventing metastability and data corruption.
